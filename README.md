# multi-ai-search

Simple web app to search multiple AI engines at once.

## TODO

- [ ] Allow users to customize/save their preferred engine list (using localStorage)
- [ ] Add more search engines (e.g., Claude, Grok - if URL params allow)
- [ ] Support choose suitable engines using AI algorithms
- [ ] Improve UI feedback (e.g., "opening tabs..." message)
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle using CSS variables
- [ ] Refactor JS for better modularity (e.g., separate URL generation)
